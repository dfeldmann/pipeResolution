abstract = {The numerical simulation of a flow through a duct requires an externally specified forcing that makes the fluid flow against viscous friction. To this end, it is customary to enforce a constant value for either the flow rate (CFR) or the pressure gradient (CPG). When comparing a laminar duct flow before and after a geometrical modification that induces a change of the viscous drag, both approaches lead to a change of the power input across the comparison. Similarly, when carrying out direct numerical simulation or large-eddy simulation of unsteady turbulent flows, the power input is not constant over time. Carrying out a simulation at constant power input (CPI) is thus a further physically sound option, that becomes particularly appealing in the context of flow control, where a comparison between control-on and control-off conditions has to be made. We describe how to carry out a CPI simulation, and start with defining a new power-related Reynolds number, whose velocity scale is the bulk flow that can be attained with a given pumping power in the laminar regime. Under the CPI condition, we derive a relation that is equivalent to the Fukagata–Iwamoto–Kasagi relation valid for CFR (and to its extension valid for CPG), that presents the additional advantage of naturally including the required control power. The implementation of the CPI approach is then exemplified in the standard case of a plane turbulent channel flow, and then further applied to a flow control case, where a spanwise-oscillating wall is used for skin-friction drag reduction. For this low-Reynolds-number flow, using 90 {\%} of the available power for the pumping system and the remaining 10 {\%} for the control system is found to be the optimum share that yields the largest increase of the flow rate above the reference case where 100 {\%} of the power goes to the pump.},

@article{Quadrio2016,
abstract = {We seek possible statistical consequences of the way a forcing term is added to the Navier--Stokes equations in the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of incompressible channel flow. Simulations driven by constant flow rate, constant pressure gradient and constant power input are used to build large databases, and in particular to store the complete temporal trace of the wall-shear stress for later analysis. As these approaches correspond to different dynamical systems, it can in principle be envisaged that these differences are reflect by certain statistics of the turbulent flow field. The instantaneous realizations of the flow in the various simulations are obviously different, but, as expected, the usual one-point, one-time statistics do not show any appreciable difference. However, the PDF for the fluctuations of the streamwise component of wall friction reveals that the simulation with constant flow rate presents lower probabilities for extreme events of large positive friction. The low probability value of such events explains their negligible contribution to the commonly computed statistics; however, the very existence of a difference in the PDF demonstrates that the forcing term is not entirely uninfluential. Other statistics for wall-based quantities (the two components of friction and pressure) are examined; in particular spatio-temporal autocorrelations show small differences at large temporal separations, where unfortunately the residual statistical uncertainty is still of the same order of the observed difference. Hence we suggest that the specific choice of the forcing term does not produce important statistical consequences, unless one is interested in the strongest events of high wall friction, that are underestimated by a simulation run at constant flow rate.},

abstract = {Results from a spectral element large eddy simulation of turbulent pipe flow are presented for a bulk flow Reynolds number of 36700. The LES uses a Smagorinsky subgrid- scale stress model and, becausethe wall layers are resolved, van Driest-type wall damping is required. Although the geometry has cylindrical symmetry, Cartesian coordinates were employed, illustrating the potential of the method to model complex geometries with unstructured meshes. Sim- ulation results compare favorably with experimental mea- surements at the same Reynolds number, demonstrating the possibility of performing large eddy simulation with the method in geometrically more complicated systems.},

@book{Pope2000,
abstract = {This is a graduate text on turbulent flows, an important topic in fluid dynamics. It is up-to-date, comprehensive, designed for teaching, and is based on a course taught by the author at Cornell University for a number of years. The book consists of two parts followed by a number of appendices. Part I provides a general introduction to turbulent flows, how they behave, how they can be described quantitatively, and the fundamental physical processes involved. Part II is concerned with different approaches for modelling or simulating turbulent flows. The necessary mathematical techniques are presented in the appendices. This book is primarily intended as a graduate level text in turbulent flows for engineering students, but it may also be valuable to students in applied mathematics, physics, oceanography and atmospheric sciences, as well as researchers and practising engineers.},

@phdthesis{Feldmann2015c,
abstract = {In this thesis, I studied the turbulent motion in oscillating pipe flow (OP) by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS) techniques. Un- derstanding shear-driven turbulence in oscillating internal flows is of general scientific importance and OP is a canonical test case for this class of problems. Moreover, the major motivation for the ad- dressed topic results from the modelling character of the OP-system to study the respiratory flow in human airways. Using physiological data from the literature I set-up a simplified model of this particular flow problem. A preliminary study with an emphasis on artificial respiration by means of high frequency oscil- latory ventilation (HFOV) revealed the following: The clinically relevant Reynolds numbers for typical HFOV scenarios reach maximum values of up to Re = 37 000. This is about 26 times higher compared to typical Re in quiet breathing scenarios. The relevant Womersley numbers lie between 0.06 {\textless}Wo {\textless} 20. Conducting DNS of 21 different OP-scenarios within the identi- fied range of characteristic parameters revealed the following: De- pending on the choice of Re and Wo the resulting oscillatory flow is either laminar or conditionally turbulent. In one particular case, a phase asymmetry between positive (turbulent) and negative (lami- nar) half-cycles is observed. A variation of the boundary conditions showed that this hysteresis is suppressed when the mass flux instead of the pressure drop is prescribed. In general, the turbulent motion in OP is characterised by repeated decay and amplification of local velocity fluctuations. The spatio-temporal behaviour of the flow — e.g. turbulent bursting events, damping, kinetic energy redistributi- on — depends on Re and Wo as well as on their ratio. By analysing phase-averaged velocity data, it was found that turbulence in OP is in some aspects quite similar but also distinctly different compared to well-understood fully-developed turbulent shear flows. The com- parison of the DNS data with theoretical predictions for a laminar OP showed that the onset of turbulence has considerable influence on the oscillating flow. Typical viscous effects of the laminar OP are reduced due to turbulent mixing. The analysis of integral quantities revealed that in some particular cases the onset of turbulence enhan- ces the maximum flow rate (up to 5{\%}) at reduced values of the wall- shear stress (up to 14 {\%}).},

In contrast to many previous DNS's of turbulent flows in rectangular geometries, the present DNS code, developed for a cylindrical geometry, is based on the finite volume technique rather than being based on a spectral method. The statistical results are compared with experimental data obtained with two different experimental techniques. The agreement between numerical and experimental results is found to be good which indicates that the present DNS code is suited for this kind of numerical simulations.},

@article{Eggels1994,
abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) and experiments are carried out to study fully developed turbulent pipe flow at Reynolds number Re, M 7000 based on centreline velocity and pipe diameter. The agreement between numerical and experimental results is excellent for the lower-order statistics (mean flow and turbulence intensities) and reasonably good for the higher-order statistics (skewness and flatness factors). To investigate the differences between fully developed turbulent flow in an axisymmetric pipe and a plane channel geometry, the present DNS results are compared to those obtained from a channel flow simulation. Beside the mean flow properties and turbulence statistics up to fourth order, the energy budgets of the Reynolds-stress components are computed and compared. The present results show that the mean velocity profile in the pipe fails to conform to the accepted law of the wall, in contrast to the channel flow. This confirms earlier observations reported in the literature. The statistics on fluctuating velocities, including the energy budgets of the Reynolds stresses, appear to be less affected by the axisymmetric pipe geometry. Only the skewness factor of the normal-to-the-wall velocity fluctuations differs in the pipe flow compared to the channel flow. The energy budgets illustrate that the normal-to-the- wall velocity fluctuations in the pipe are altered owing to a different ‘impingement' or ‘splatting' mechanism close to the curved wall.},
